# Sentinel: Autonomous RAG-Driven Framework
### *Industrial Fault Diagnosis & Predictive Maintenance*

## Project Vision
In modern manufacturing, unexpected downtime costs industries millions. **Sentinel** is an intelligent monitoring system designed to bridge the gap between raw sensor data and expert engineering knowledge.

* **Minimize Downtime**: Predict mechanical failures before they occur by analyzing vibration trends.
* **Standardize Diagnostics**: Use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to ensure every diagnosis is grounded in international standards like **ISO 20816** and **SKF manuals**.
* **Empower Technicians**: Provide clear, actionable maintenance plans generated by AI, reducing the need for constant senior expert intervention.

---

## Key Features
* **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of asset health via sensor log ingestion.
* **Knowledge-Backed AI**: A diagnostic engine that "reads" technical manuals to explain the *Why* behind every fault.
* **Automated Reporting**: Instant generation of maintenance tickets and historical trend analysis.
* **Offline Readiness**: Built to run on local factory servers (on-premise) to ensure data privacy and security.

---

## Tech Stack
* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance asynchronous API handling.
* **Frontend**: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS (Migrating from HTML/CSS prototypes).
* **AI/LLM**: Localized LLMs (Qwen-2.5 / Llama-3.2) for secure, on-site inference.
* **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for managing technical knowledge embeddings.
* **Database**: Relational Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for asset and history management.

## Getting Started

### 1. System Requirements
* Python 3.10+
* Node.js & npm
* Relational DB (PostgreSQL or MySQL)

### 2. Installation
1.  **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FatmaAMR/Sentinel-AI.git
    ```
2.  **Backend Setup**:
    * Navigate to `/backend`, create a virtual environment, and install `requirements.txt`.
    * Configure your `.env` file with your Database URL and HuggingFace Token.
3.  **Frontend Setup**:
    * Navigate to `/frontend` and run `npm install`.
