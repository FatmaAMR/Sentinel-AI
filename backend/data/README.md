# Sentinel Data Store

This folder is the central repository for all raw and processed data used by the RAG pipeline.

### Expected Sub-folders:
- `/manuals/`: Place all technical PDFs here (ISO standards, SKF manuals, etc.).
- `/logs/`: Storage for synthetic or real-world vibration logs (CSV/JSON).
- `sentinel.db`

**Note to Team:** Do not commit large PDF files to GitHub. Only place them here locally for testing.
